# Sudoku Solver - Java

My Sudoku Solver will be able to take user sudoku board inputs, check if it solvable and then solve 
sudoku board, displaying the solved board as a result, using a recursive backtracking algorithm. If the sudoku board is 
not solvable, the application will print out a statement detailing this. It is
important to note that the current iteration of my application will be limited to
9 x 9 sudoku boards.

This application can be used by anyone with an interest in sudoku but needs help
in solving a sudoku board. This application serves to check whether a solvable, 
as well as displaying the solved board for the user.
