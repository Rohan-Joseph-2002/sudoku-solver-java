# Sudoku Solver - Java

Hi, and Welcome to my Graphical User Interface Sudoku Solver!

My Sudoku Solver will be able to take in any sudoku board input, check if it is solvable, solve the
given board and display the solved board. If the given board is not solvable, then the application
will display a message indicating this. In addition to all of this, my application will be able to
save your sudoku answer boards to a local file, from which a saved board can be reviewed later.

*It is important to note that this current iteration of my application is limited to only 
9 by 9 sudoku boards.*

I hope you all find this application useful!

**Cheers,**

**Rohan Joseph**
